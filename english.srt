1
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,660
It's been a year, Saint Disciple Iska.

2
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,620
You're that girl from prison?

3
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,410
My name is Sisbell. I'm honored
that you remembered me.

4
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,450
I do apologize for breaking into your
room in the middle of the night.

5
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:37,990
However, um, I'm not accustomed
to being treated this way.

6
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,830
Huh?

7
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,540
I would appreciate it if you could move...

8
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,740
Oh, s-sorry!

9
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,660
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World

10
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,990
How...?

11
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:39,080
Lady Sisbell must have been investigating
that Imperial swordsman.

12
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,490
Could she have seen Iska and
I meet in the neutral city?!

13
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,540
With her astral spirit, it's possible!

14
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,540
Please calm down, Lady Alice.

15
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,490
Lady Sisbell's astral spirit can only
see within the radius of 300m.

16
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,740
It's impossible for her to see
an event in the neutral city.

17
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,660
Maybe she heard our conversation
in the castle, then?

18
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,990
I was being careful, but...

19
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:09,040
Perhaps Lady Sisbell suspects you
and the Empire are connected?

20
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,660
May I call you Iska?

21
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,330
I'm truly sorry for letting myself
into your room.

22
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:36,990
I also didn't say a word of gratitude
when you freed me from that prison.

23
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:42,870
I must admit that, at the time,
I feared it was the Empire's trap.

24
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,790
So please let me show you my appreciation now.

25
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,330
I-I can't accept that.
That isn't why I saved you.

26
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,830
After you saved me, I read
about you in the newspaper.

27
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:07,240
The Emperor's direct report had committed
a crime of breaking out a witch.

28
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,740
That story had spread widely,
even to the neighboring neutral cities.

29
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,490
Is that why you know my name?

30
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:17,450
Yes. And now, it is my turn to return the favor.

31
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:23,700
You lost your status and honor because of me,
so I will promise that and more.

32
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,040
I will guarantee your status and safety.

33
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,160
So please! Would you accompany me
to the Sovereignty?

34
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,370
Who are you?

35
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:43,160
I am a servant of the royal palace...

36
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,370
I do have a question.

37
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,330
Yes?

38
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,120
Why me?

39
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,160
If you're close to the royal family,
you must have many people under you.

40
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,700
I do not... I cannot trust anybody!

41
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,040
I'm sorry. I let my emotions
get the better of me.

42
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,620
I will come back.
I'm glad I got to see you today.

43
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,870
What should I do...?

44
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,790
Your Majesty.

45
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,830
We could not find anything.

46
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,160
I see.

47
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,700
However, I would like to offer a plan.

48
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,330
What is it?

49
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,160
If you would allow Lady Alice
to go on a long-distance trip...

50
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,950
Lady Sisbell is in a foreign nation, far away.

51
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:58,580
Since she cannot remain cooped up
in her room, she cannot hide anything.

52
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:04,290
If Lady Alice, her older sister,
talks to her alone, she may confide in her.

53
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,410
They are sisters, after all.

54
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,790
Alice, could I ask that of you?

55
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,160
Yes, Mother!

56
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,870
Rin, go make the arrangements.

57
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,080
Of course.

58
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,620
Sisbell, what are you up to?

59
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,740
What are you doing, Sisbell?

60
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,330
This is unlike you. You simulated
all this a number of times.

61
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,580
I will try again. I will not give up.

62
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,870
We received new intel from our ally.

63
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,790
A purebred witch,

64
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:01,240
a daughter of Queen Nebulis at that,
is headed to the independent nation.

65
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,490
By herself?

66
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:08,040
She only took her servant. Without guards,
she's as good as traveling alone.

67
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,540
What does our ally say?

68
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,830
That they'll give her over to the Empire.

69
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,080
What?

70
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,620
Is that true?

71
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:22,540
Perfect. Capturing a purebred is
our primary goal. We must not fail.

72
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,790
Shall we deploy the Object ?

73
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:29,290
That witch-hunting weapon
cannot be tied back to us.

74
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,660
And nothing can stop it.

75
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,990
Let us start the witch hunt.

76
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,660
Ah, this is the life. What a treat
to have BBQ for breakfast.

77
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,360
When we were still in the Empire--

78
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,160
Stop talking and help, Boss.

79
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,990
Then I'll grill the meat!

80
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:57,490
Oh, not yet, Captain! You have to start
with veggies that take long to cook.

81
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,580
Here you go.

82
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:04,040
Aww, come on, don't spoil the fun!
Let's go ahead and grill the meat!

83
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,200
Right, Iska?

84
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,120
No, you can't. Right, Iska?

85
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,910
Something on his mind?

86
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,290
Thank you for coming, Elletear.

87
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:32,450
So could you elaborate on what
you said the other day?

88
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,700
The ones trying to get in touch
with the Empire...

89
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,870
...are my sisters.

90
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,080
You must excuse me.
I wasn't expecting that at all.

91
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,040
Coming to me with such a thing
will be disadvantageous for the Lou.

92
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,740
Are you sure you want to tell me this?

93
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:10,200
Yes. The future of the Sovereignty
is more important than the election.

94
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:17,700
I understand. I hear you loud and clear.
How can I be of assistance?

95
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:24,120
If my sisters plan to betray the Sovereignty,
it is my duty to stop them.

96
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:30,240
However, I may not be able to do
the right thing when the time comes.

97
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,910
My feelings towards them might
get in the way. That's why...

98
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:41,080
You want me to be the judge instead?

99
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:51,950
Lift your head up. It must've
been hard to carry all that weight.

100
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,370
I'll personally see to it to find out the truth.

101
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,580
Please take good care of my younger sisters.

102
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,870
Leave the rest to me, Elletear.

103
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:15,120
This desert creature has evolved considerably
to survive the harsh environment.

104
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,990
At the top of the pyramid is a large
beast we all know: the basilisk.

105
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,350
It's been years since I travelled without Rin.

106
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,870
But please don't be alarmed.
Even if we do encounter a basilisk,

107
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,040
we have a specialized hunter with us.

108
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,540
W-We're terribly sorry about that.

109
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,450
What's going on?

110
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,410
There are footprints ahead,
so please give us a moment.

111
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,120
E-Excuse me! You shouldn't leave--

112
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,620
It's not from a basilisk.

113
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,990
Smell of machine oil...

114
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,620
This doesn't look good.

115
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:31,700
Hey, Iska. Are we at the hotel yet?
I'm so tired, I can't take another step.

116
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,950
We're almost there.

117
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,450
I wouldn't have minded staying
at yesterday's hotel again,

118
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:42,450
but you're so careful to want
to change our lodging, Iska.

119
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,660
I'm being economical with our budget.

120
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:50,200
We can stay somewhere with the same grade
but cheaper if we leave downtown.

121
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,580
Something may happen again
if we stayed at that hotel...

122
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,490
I don't want to involve everyone.

123
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,490
Oh, hold up, Captain.

124
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,290
It's peeling off.

125
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,950
Oh, sorry! That's right, we need to
do something about this astral crest, too.

126
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,990
You won't figure anything out,
Boss, so just have fun.

127
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,700
That's so mean, Jhin!

128
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,290
Iska, Nene, and I brainstormed
and came up with nothing.

129
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,330
It's better to step away from it
and go back to the drawing board later.

130
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,660
We still have 60 days.

131
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,160
Yeah...

132
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:39,830
But if you're worried, I guess
we can go to the general market.

133
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,370
General market?

134
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,450
This is an independent nation.

135
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:48,580
It isn't the Empire or the Sovereignty,
so they have products from both.

136
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,040
Jhin, is the product we're
looking for what I think it is?

137
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,870
Yeah, the sticker Captain Shanorotte had.

138
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:05,040
We just need a similar product that has
been developed by the Sovereignty.

139
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,700
Even learning the manufacturing process will do.

140
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,830
You're so reliable, Jhin!

141
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,120
Then we'll hit the general market
tomorrow morning!

142
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,160
We're here.

143
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,580
I'll go exchange currencies for tomorrow,
so you guys go on ahead.

144
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,830
We're going out for dinner soon, so hurry back.

145
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,410
Roger that.

146
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,160
Iska, give me your stuff.

147
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,200
Oh.

148
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,660
Thanks.

149
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,580
She's not here.

150
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,040
Good evening, Iska.

151
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,910
What kind of magic trick did you use?

152
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:16,290
I said I would come back.
I will not be giving up.

153
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,830
Okay, but let's go somewhere else.

154
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,410
It was just today when I
decided to change hotels.

155
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,370
But you were already here before me.

156
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,580
Is this related to your astral spirit?

157
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,040
It is as you say.

158
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:54,540
My astral spirit has the ability
to display the past, like a video.

159
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,490
Today around noon, you called that hotel.

160
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:03,160
You repeated the room number
and when you could check-in.

161
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,120
I was able to replay every past event.

162
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,830
Wow... A rare astral spirit that
interferes with space-time, huh?

163
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:17,830
But is it okay for you to give me,
an Imperial soldier, such crucial intel?

164
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,700
It's my way of showing my sincerity.

165
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,490
Yesterday, I lied about one thing.

166
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,910
A lie?

167
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,700
My name is Sisbell Lou Nebulis IX.

168
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,540
I'm an official successor to the throne.

169
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,700
Nebulis?! She's Alice's sister!

170
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,990
You don't believe me?

171
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,240
No, I believe you.
That's why I'm so surprised.

172
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:53,620
But it makes even less sense. Why would
the queen's daughter want me?

173
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:00,580
Someone is after our queen's life.
Someone who's a descendant of the Founder.

174
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,160
But they're the same royal bloodline!

175
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,290
Yes. This person is not after the Sovereignty.

176
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:14,990
They're after something far more disastrous,
a change for the worse.

177
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:20,990
If the queen dies, the next move would be
a full-scale war against the Empire.

178
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,040
Both nations will fall.

179
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,870
That's their plan.

180
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,790
To drag the Sovereignty into war,

181
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,990
and seize on the confusion
to eliminate the royal family.

182
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,040
They're after you, too?

183
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:41,290
Yes. I learned of this plan
with my astral power.

184
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:50,580
However, I don't know who's behind this.
That's why I cannot trust anyone!

185
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,160
Iska, I want you!

186
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,790
Do you wish for death and destruction?!

187
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:03,620
A future in which both the Empire and
the Sovereignty destroy each other?!

188
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,370
Do you wish for such a doomsday?!

189
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:08,660
No.

190
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,120
That is why I ask of you to be my protector!

191
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,950
If I can defeat the evil going after the queen,

192
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:18,080
a full-scale war can be avoided,
the doomsday stopped!

193
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,950
I won't ask you to betray the Empire in spirit,

194
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,990
but I want you to change the future with me!

195
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,490
This isn't good... It took so long to get here.

196
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,700
The hotel Sisbell is staying at is...

197
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,290
Lady Alice?

198
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,790
I was right! It is you, Lady Alice!

199
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,700
Schwartz!

200
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,410
Wh-What a coincidence. Um...

201
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,660
Have you seen Lady Sisbell?

202
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,740
Huh?

203
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,200
I can't get a hold of Lady Sisbell.

204
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,120
She went off on her own, saying
she had something to do, but...

205
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:20,040
I'm with you. I absolutely don't want
an outright war between the two nations.

206
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,990
I'm glad you understand!

207
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,330
But I can't go with you.

208
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,910
What? What do you mean?

209
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:34,160
If the queen is killed, the Sovereignty
will fall into the traitor's hands!

210
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,080
Then a full-scale war between
the two nations will be unavoidable!

211
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,700
In order to avoid that--

212
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,830
That's the difference between us.

213
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,830
What?

214
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,660
It's not just the full-scale war I want to stop.

215
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:52,700
I want to resolve the 100-year-conflict
between the two nations.

216
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,910
B-But how?

217
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,200
Peace negotiation.

218
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,370
That's impossible! To forgive the Empire
for everything they've done?!

219
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,830
Our people will never forgive the Empire!

220
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:09,740
I know that. But my reason
for fighting is for that cause.

221
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,910
It's not just me.

222
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:22,580
There's someone close by within
the Sovereignty that you can rely on.

223
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,450
Who's--?

224
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,790
How disappointing.

225
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:31,660
This is such a heart-wrenching outcome, Sisbell.

226
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,830
Masked Lord?! Why are you here?

227
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:43,120
Just a vacation to escape the hustle
and bustle. Nothing odd with that.

228
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,830
He's that guy who kicked
Captain into the vortex...

229
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,120
What is odd is you, Sisbell.

230
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,040
Who is the boy standing next to you?

231
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,370
H-He's...

232
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:05,240
No need to lie. I've had a run-in
with that Imperial soldier before.

233
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:11,830
The queen will be devastated to learn
her daughter is connected to the Empire.

234
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:17,240
Don't jump to conclusions, Masked Lord!
I've not switched sides to the Empire.

235
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,540
It's the opposite. I want to
save our nation from a traitor.

236
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,040
You're the traitor.

237
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,490
So that's what this is about.

238
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,790
The Zoas do not care about the truth

239
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:40,410
as long as they have evidence to gain
the upper hand in the election.

240
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,700
You're free to think what you like.

241
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:51,330
It's too bad I have to capture you
for suspicion of treason.

242
00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:00,240
Oh? You certainly are the queen's daughter
to still have the will to resist.

243
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,910
You won't go down quietly?

244
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,290
Chase her.

245
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,490
Masked Lord, was it?
Aren't you on the same side?

246
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,120
A traitor deserves no mercy.

247
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,950
Especially since she's connected
to an Imperial soldier like you.

248
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,240
You're not interested in her reasoning?

249
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,410
It doesn't matter. Betrayl to be
with the Empire is a crime in itself.

250
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:32,330
Now, I'm going to ask you to disappear.

251
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:37,410
This is checkmate.

252
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,620
That's...!

253
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,990
